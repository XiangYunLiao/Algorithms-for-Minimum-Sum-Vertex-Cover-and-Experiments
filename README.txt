This project is divided into two parts.
There are two files for the code, one is approximation algorithms and the other one is the parameterized algorithm.

------approximation.inpyb------
This is the code of the first part of the project, can be run on Jupyter notebook.
Some of the plots at the end of this file are the line plots for the performance of second part of the project (data was produced by parmeterized.inpyb).

------parameterized.inpyb------
This is the code of the second part of the project, cannot be run on Jupyter notebook due to the interruption does not work on it.
This was run on Google colab, which is a free Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud.

------Performance tables------
This is the folder including the running result of the project.
The results were used to generate the line plots in the dissertation.
The file name is the condition of the tests.
